<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">The DebugObject has 4 properties (all of which apply before the Start of Frame event):<br>
<p>
<b>Enable at start</b><br>
Enables debug output at start (crashes are handled anyway, but won't be logged).<br>
<b>Show message if path invalid</b><br>
This will cause a message box to appear if output was enabled, and a crash has been caught, before the log file path has been opened. After the message box is closed, the application will be closed.<br><br>
<b>Initial path</b><br>
This is the default log path. It will be opened at the start of the application (and as normal, print an open-log message).<br><br>
<b>Console enabled</b><br>
Enable the console at the start of the application (will show all log messages and receive input commands).<br>
</p>
